Assignment plan 

ALBERT 
> load premade map of the environment 

> or use our own module to get initial pose estimate using Monte Carlo / use 2D pose estimate 

CEM
> use camera module to continually assess environment for each of the 4 objects 
	> red, green, blue detection for hydrant, box and mailbox 
	> text detection to find the 5-box 
	> depth camera finds distance to object of interest, for use in grid

ALBERT
> use grid module to create a probability map for the location of each object 
	> eg. if green box not in line of sight, all line of sight squares probability = 0
	> use this to create frontiers where objects might be found
	> combine all 4 object's frontiers to choose the best frontier
	> set a waypoint to the best frontier 

BEN
> if an object of interest is detected by camera module, stop exploration behaviour, move towards object
> once within 1 meter of object, that object is FOUND and no longer used in deciding exploration behaviour
> use avoidance behaviour to prevent hitting walls etc 


BEN 
Behaviour management 

> object-oriented state management 
> state hierarchy (high to low level)
  > frontier exploration 
    > moving towards object
      > avoidance
