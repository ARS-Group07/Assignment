Assignment plan 

stuff left to do
1. test objects in different positions
2. turn 360 after reaching goal? - if not finding objects with other changes
3. if detects another object while homing towards first - save last object location in memory
4. only start detection once localised ?? maybe, doesn't matter that much
5. clean code
